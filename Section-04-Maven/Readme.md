# Java Maven Project

This project is built using **Apache Maven**, a build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects. Maven simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application.

## What is Maven?

**Maven** is a powerful tool used to:
- Manage **dependencies** (external libraries and frameworks).
- Automate the **build** process (compiling, testing, packaging).
- Provide an **easy-to-follow project structure**.
- Ensure consistency across all developers and build environments.

It uses an XML configuration file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) to define the project setup, dependencies, and plugins.
